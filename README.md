# About
This React App is currently a prototype I have built for my IS 542 class. While there is a payment processing area in this app, it is yet to be set up so your card will not be charged. No sales will happen while using this website. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skill with JavaScript development. While this website functions simply, the code behind it is quite extensive and will be very useful for scaling up should I choose to do so. Check out my code to see this for yourself.

I hope you enjoy my project, to authenticate yourself:

I used the following technologies in this project:
- JavaScript
- - Leveraged OOP for data representation 
Promise API
Asynchronous Programing 
Creating utility classes that I actually used more than once
Handling user state globally
React.js
State management with React Context
React Hooks
useEffect
useState
useRef
useContext
This was my first time being almost solely dependent on React functional instead of class components. It was quite the learning experience and I can now say I fully support functional React. 

Material UI
Css in JavaScript
Animations
Global Theme with ReactContext
Any general Material UI Components used in this App
React Router
Sub Switches
Private Routes
Redirects 
Firebase Auth
Email / Password
Sign in with Google
User event listener
Firebase Firestore (database)
Leveraged sub collections 
Designed data for scalability
Firebase Hosting
This is being hosted by Firebase! 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
